Cheesy Eggs for One

Ingredients:


2-3 T milk
2-3 large eggs
1 T cooking oil
Cavender's Seasoning
1/4-1/3 cup preferred brand of shredded cheese

In a medium bowl scramble eggs. Once consistent, add in milk and scramble, again, to consistency.

In a medium to large skillet/ frying pan, heat oil on medium. Ensure oils is hot before proceeding (this prevents the eggs from sticking in some pans.)

Add scramble (eggs and milk) to pan and "scrape" eggs from bottom of pan, rolling them into one mass. 

Add Cavender's seasoning to eggs while about half firm (if added while eggs are runny, the seasoning will clump.) Season to taste, but keep in mind, this is a salted seasoning- I suggest starting with the same amount you would use if it were table salt.

Once eggs are firm, but not oranged (which indicates overcooking, IMHO) turn off heat and sprinkle cheese on top of eggs. Remove eggs once cheese is melted.
